# Dactylotest

A dactylotest made with [Processing](https://processing.org/) (that's like a superset of java).

If you want to use it, simply double click on **DactyloTest.exe** in _builds/application.windows32_ or _builds/application.windows64_.

If you want to modify the source code, first [download Processing](https://processing.org/download) (no need to install), launch it, then open the file **src/DactyloTest/DactyloTest.pde**.

It's one of my first coding project, so many things are written in french (sorry), and it's way under-optimized. It still runs smoothly.
